<p class='bold'>
    All patients being treated with CHANTIX should be observed for neuropsychiatric
    symptoms including changes in behavior,<br />
    hostility, agitation, depressed mood, and suicide-related events, including ideation,
    behavior, and attempted suicide. These<br />
    symptoms, as well as worsening of pre-existing psychiatric illness and completed
    suicide have been reported in some patients<br />
    attempting to quit smoking while taking CHANTIX in postmarketing experience.
</p>
<p class="bold">
    These events have occurred in patients with and without pre-existing psychiatric
    disease. Patients with serious psychiatric<br>
    illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder did
    not participate in the premarketing studies<br>
    of CHANTIX.
</p>
<p class='bold'>
    Advise patients and caregivers that the patient should stop taking CHANTIX and contact
    a healthcare provider immediately if<br />
    agitation, hostility, depressed mood, or changes in behavior or thinking that are
    not typical for the patient are observed, or if the<br />
    patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior. In many postmarketing cases,
    resolution of symptoms after discontinuation<br />
    of CHANTIX was reported, although in some cases the symptoms persisted; therefore,
    ongoing monitoring and supportive care<br />
    should be provided until symptoms resolve.
</p>
<p>
    CHANTIX is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity
    or skin reactions to CHANTIX.
</p>
<p>
    During clinical trials and the postmarketing experience, there have been reports
    of seizures in patients treated with CHANTIX, with or<br />
    without a history of seizures. CHANTIX should be used cautiously in patients with
    a history of seizures or other factors that can lower the<br />
    seizure threshold. Instruct patients to discontinue CHANTIX, and contact a healthcare
    provider immediately if they experience a seizure<br />
    while on treatment.
</p>
<p>
    There have been postmarketing reports of patients experiencing increased intoxicating
    effects of alcohol while taking CHANTIX, including<br />
    unusual and sometimes aggressive behavior directed to oneself or to others and often
    accompanied by amnesia. Advise patients to<br />
    reduce the amount of alcohol they consume while taking CHANTIX until they know whether
    CHANTIX affects their tolerance for alcohol.
</p>
<p>
    Patients should be informed that there have been reports of serious skin reactions,
    such as Stevens Johnson Syndrome and Erythema<br />
    Multiforme and of angioedema, with swelling of the face, mouth, and neck that can
    lead to life-threatening respiratory compromise.<br />
    Patients should be instructed to discontinue CHANTIX and immediately seek medical
    care if they experience these symptoms or at the first<br />
    sign of rash with mucosal lesions or any other signs of hypersensitivity.
</p>
<p>
    In a meta-analysis of clinical trials including a trial in patients with stable
    cardiovascular disease, while serious cardiovascular events were<br />
    infrequent overall, certain serious cardiovascular events were reported more frequently
    in patients treated with CHANTIX than placebo.<br />
    These events occurred primarily in patients with known cardiovascular disease. Instruct
    patients to notify their healthcare providers of new<br />
    or worsening cardiovascular symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if
    they experience signs and symptoms of myocardial<br />
    infarction or stroke.
</p>
<p>
    The most common adverse reactions include nausea (30%), abnormal dreams, constipation,
    flatulence, and vomiting. Patients should be<br />
    informed that they may experience vivid, unusual, or strange dreams during treatment
    with CHANTIX. Patients should be advised to use<br />
    caution driving or operating machinery or engaging in other potentially hazardous
    activities until they know how CHANTIX may affect them.
</p>
<p>
    Safety and efficacy of CHANTIX in combination with other smoking cessation drug
    therapies have not been studied. Dosage adjustment<br />
    with CHANTIX is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment or in patients
    undergoing hemodialysis.
</p>
<p>
    Smoking cessation, with or without treatment with CHANTIX, may alter the pharmacokinetics
    or pharmacodynamics of some drugs, such<br />
    as theophylline, warfarin, and insulin. Dosage adjustment for these drugs may be
    necessary.
</p>
<h4 class='bold'>
    INDICATION</h4>
<p>
    CHANTIX is indicated as an aid to smoking cessation treatment in adults 18 and over.
    Patients may benefit from behavioral modification<br />
    and support during their quit attempt. Patients should be encouraged to continue
    to attempt to quit if they have lapses after quit day.
