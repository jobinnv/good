<p class='foot'>
    This was a general population survey (N=6000) representative of the
    United States (balanced across age, race, geography, education,
    varying levels of smoking, etc) to<br /> identify smokers and recent quitters
    for analysis of smoking behaviors and attitudes. Of those surveyed,
    2939 smokers and recent quitters were included in the final analysis.<br />
    2711 respondents were tobacco smokers, 1072 were e-cigarette
    smokers (37 smoked e-cigarettes only), and 191 were recent quitters
    (within 1 to 5 years). Respondents were <br />aged 18 to 75 years and smoked at
    least 3 tobacco cigarettes or 1 e-cigarette per day for &ge;1 year.

    Among other questions, respondents answered the following: Please indicate the extent
    to which you use, or have
    used, the following products: tobacco cigarettes,<br /> e-cigarettes, nicotine replacement
    products (eg, gum, patch, etc).
    Realizing that the number may vary/likely varied, on average how many tobacco
    cigarettes do you/did you <br />smoke
    per day?

    else), and 688 were using both
